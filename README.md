# MultiMaterial
<h1>ReadMe</h1>
<p>To install simply create a project in Unity. Then add this repo in the assets folder of your project. There are 2 new Scriptable object types that can be accessed by right clicking in the project view in the Create menu.</p> 
<p><b>Material Texture Settings</b> is under Create => Multi Material => Material Texture Settings and can be used to assign textures to <b>UDIM</b> materials. The custom inspector is able to apply the texture setting to selected materials and assumes the material and texture are named according to UDIM conventions. <b>Texture Name</b> is the material property name of the texture field and <b>Search Dir</b> is the directory that contains the textures for that material property. Multi Material Data is under Create => Multi Material => Multi Material Data and holds an array of Materials for use in <b>Multi Material</b> Component or you can directly modify the materials from the scriptable object’s inspector.</p>
<p>The <b>Multi Material</b> Component can be added to a Game Object to control the Shared Materials array in the object’s Renderer. If a Multi Material Data is created from the render or assigned from the project that data can be modified here. This can be useful if you have Multiple objects that share a group of Materials that need to be modified a once.<p>
